Legends of Runeterra Randomizer

At the randomizer nav button you can randomize your very own that that you can play with! at the different nav-items with regions (demacia, freljord, ionia, noxus, PandZ, shadow isles) you can take a look
at the different champions(iconic units that all bring a different win-condition for your play), followers(units that can help achieve a win con or get control of the game) and spells(cards that have effects either helping you or messing with the opponent)!
In the footer you can take a look at the site of "Legends of Runeterra" and the most recent Patch notes (which has updates regarding to the game).

This site is made for people that enjoy playing Legends of Runeterra but are not sure as to what kind of deck they want to play. Take a look at all the different options then select what
regions and what playstle you would like to play and its randomize time!!

The randomizer option will let you randomize your deck.
The different pages is the navigation will show you the different regions to take a look at what they contain.
In the footer you can find links to the site and the most recent patch notes.

When I learn more about javascript and other programs ill make it so that the site will actually randomize and allow you to get a random set of cards to play with!

I plan to add the total costs and rarity of the cards needed so that you can see if you can afford them or not.

I have used a dropdown menu coding from bootstrap https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/dropdowns/

Besides the randomizer option that will be added at a later date the site works well and has been tested in different screen sizes to make sure it looks good in all of them!
